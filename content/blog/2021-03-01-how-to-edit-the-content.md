title: Testing a new kind of website
description: And getting to grips with a headless site
---
So, I'm finally practicing what I preach and getting to grips with headless. This is very, **very** new and I think it's going to take a bit of getting used to. 

I'm writing this post mostly so I can see what it looks like on the frontend, and to actually add something of my own. 

In time, I'll try and add imagery and other good stuff to blogs, but this is it for now as I still need to build out the assets folder.
