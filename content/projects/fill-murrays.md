I had the pleasure of speaking at July 2021's instalment of brightonSEO. My talk focused on getting to grips with headless websites and, more specifically, the key things that we need to consider as SEOs when moving to a headless site. 

In the talk, I covered: 

* What headless websites are (and how they differ from traditional/monolithic sites)
* The benefits of headless websites
* Things to consider when moving over to a headless site
